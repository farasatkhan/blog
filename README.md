```

2. Create and clone your new GitHub repository:

3. Initialize Hugo site in the repository:

```
hugo new site . --force
```

4. Add the `hugo-blog-awesome` theme as a Git submodule:

```
git submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome.git themes/hugo-blog-awesome
```

5. Configure your site by adding the theme to hugo.toml:

```
theme = 'hugo-blog-awesome'
```

6. Create a `build.yml` file in the directory `.github\workflows\` in order to set up a workflow for GitHub Actions. Copy and Paste the `build.yml` content from this repository.

Once configured, GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site when you push changes to your repository. You can monitor the deployment status in the Actions tab of your repository.
